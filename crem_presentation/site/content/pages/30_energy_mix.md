BodyTitle: Non-fossil energy increases significantly in all scenarios

China’s non-fossil energy target is met in all scenarios. Both a feed-in tariff for renewable energy plus the CO₂ price make low carbon energy deployment a relatively stable feature of all scenarios, while the coal requirement is highly sensitive to the level of policy stringency. Natural gas and oil demand are far less sensitive, given their lower CO₂ content and lack of substitutes in some uses.
