Header: China's target of 20% of energy from non-fossil sources is met in 2030 in the 4% scenario. Non-fossil sources include wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Primary energy shares are calculated using the coal-equivalent method.
BodyTitle: Non-fossil energy increases significantly in all scenarios.

China’s non-fossil energy target is met in all scenarios. Both a feed-in tariff for renewable energy plus the CO₂ price make low carbon energy deployment a relatively stable feature of all scenarios, while the fossil energy requirement is far less certain. In particular, the role of natural gas is very sensitive to the level of simulated policy effort.
