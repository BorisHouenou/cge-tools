By comparing the energy mix under the three scenarios, the non-fossil energy
target is met in all scenarios. Both a feed-in tariff for renewable energy and 
the CO2 price mean that low carbon energy deployment is a 
relatively stable feature of all scenarios, while the fossil energy requirement
is far less certain. In particular, the role of natural gas is very sensitive
to the level of simulated policy effort.
