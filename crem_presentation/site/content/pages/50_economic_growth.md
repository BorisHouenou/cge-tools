SubTitle: Slower economic growth means an earlier CO₂ emissions peak, less expansion of non-fossil energy.
Header: If economic growth is 1 percentage point slower in every year through 2030, relative to the baseline scenario, an emissions peak is achieved earlier for a given level of policy stringency.
BodyTitle: Projections are very sensitive to economic growth assumptions

In a slower economic growth scenario China’s climate pledge is easier to meet but the non-fossil energy target may be harder to meet, as new non-fossil generation will compete more directly with existing installed generation.
