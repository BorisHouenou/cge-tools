Title: Economic growth
SubTitle: If economic growth is 1% slower, peak is earlier for a given level of policy stringency, but non-fossil targets are harder to meet

BodyTitle: Slower than anticipated economic growth has a mixed effect

If economic growth is slower by 1 percentage point through 2030 relative
to the scenario assumed earlier, the climate pledge is easier to meet
but the non-fossil energy target may be harder to meet, as new non-fossil
generation will compete more directly with existing installed generation.
