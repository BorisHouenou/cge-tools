Title: CO₂ by province
SubTitleHead: Policy impacts are as diverse as China’s provinces
SubTitle: The effects of policy vary widely across China’s provinces, consistent with diverse features of provincial energy systems and economies. Under a national CO₂ price, emissions are reduced in the parts of the economy where they cost least. These parts of the economy tend to be concentrated in the rapidly industrializing central provinces, which have large populations and significant heavy industry, but have not achieved the technological level and relatively higher efficiencies of energy systems in the coastal provinces.

BodyTitle: These differences are especially pronounced when comparing the Western, Central, and Eastern parts of the country 

CO₂ emissions reductions under the 4% policy differ widely across provinces. This is because each province faces different marginal costs of reducing CO₂, which are directly related to the share of coal as an input to the provincial economy.
