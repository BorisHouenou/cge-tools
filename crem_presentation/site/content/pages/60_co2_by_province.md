BodyTitle: We can see differences across three regions of china - the West, Center and East.

CO2 emissions reductions under the 4% policy differ widely across provinces.
This is because each province faces different marginal costs of reducing CO2, which are
directly related to the share of coal as an input to the provincial economy.
We can see how provinces with a higher share of coal intensity tend to bear a higher
policy cost.
