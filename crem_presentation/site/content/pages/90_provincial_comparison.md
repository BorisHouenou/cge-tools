SubTitle: The impacts of policy on provinces can be traced to differences in population, per-capita income, and reliance on coal.
Header: Under a climate policy, reductions in CO₂ (and associated reductions in local pollutants) occur primarily over large population centers in the central part of the country. However, a CO₂ policy does not deliver as significant a reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the populous and relatively affluent eastern provinces, where CO₂ and fossil energy intensity must drop from a lower starting level and thus additional reductions prove relatively costly.
BodyTitle: Impacts on GDP are modest at the national level, but may be large in some provinces.

Provinces that rely heavily on coal as an input to production and consumption are most affected by the policy. These provinces include Hebei (HB), Jilin (JL), and Shanxi (SX), while some provinces experience much more limited impacts. How the impacts of policy are distributed is highly dependent on the initial allocation of CO₂ emissions rights, which is ultimately a choice for public policy makers.
