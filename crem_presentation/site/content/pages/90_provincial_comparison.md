Title: Provincial comparison
SubTitle: The effects of different policy scenarios are different in different parts of the country.

BodyTitle: We can see differences across three regions of china - the West, Center and East.

Comparing effects under the 4% policy across provinces/regions shows how 
the provinces that deliver large reductions in CO2 under a national emissions
trading program, which tend to be located in the center and west, are not those 
that benefit most in terms of air pollution reduction, given that many of the 
populous eastern coastal provinces use energy relatively efficiently, and
therefore experience less reduction in both CO2 and air pollutants.
