Title: Provincial comparison
SubTitleHead: Differences in population, share of coal production in provincial GDP, and the size of provincial GDP affect the impact of policy
SubTitle: While the complex economic and energy system linkages among provinces prevent simple explanations of policy impacts, some general trends are apparent.

BodyTitle: CO₂ emissions and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure fall most in populous, industrializing provinces

Relative to the No Policy scenario, CO₂ emissions are significantly lower in Shanxi, a major center of coal production, and Hubei, a province with a relatively clean energy system in 2010 that sees its coal consumption increase in the No Policy scenario. This reduction corresponds to significant reductions in air pollution exposure in China’s industrializing central provinces.

How the economic impacts of a national climate policy are distributed is ultimately a public policy choice that occurs in the design of the emissions rights (emissions trading system) or revenue recycling (tax) scheme. The distribution of GDP impacts could look very different, for instance, if a progressive scheme that required wealthy provinces to foot the bill for less affluent provinces with lower cost abatement opportunities were adopted. Without a policy aimed at redistribution, Shanxi province as a coal exporter experiences the deepest reductions in its GDP under climate policy in 2030. While only the 4% scenario is shown here, general trends are similar in the 3% and 5% scenarios.
