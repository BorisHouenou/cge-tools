SubTitleHead: Explore the Impacts of Climate Policy in China on Energy, Emissions, Air Quality, and Health
SubTitle: In every nation, sound climate policy design benefits from an understanding of the system-wide response and its associated uncertainties. This response includes not only reductions in CO₂ emissions, but also impacts on the energy system, economy, air quality, and human health. This site is devoted to understanding climate policy impacts in China.

Launched in mid-2011, the MIT-Tsinghua China Energy and Climate Project is a five-year project devoted to understanding the impact of climate policy on China’s energy and economic system. A core component of this project has been to develop a regional energy-economic model for China and linking it with a state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry model to capture impacts of policy on energy, emissions, air quality, and human health within a single framework.
