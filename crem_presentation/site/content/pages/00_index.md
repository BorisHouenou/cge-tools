BodyTitle: In the 4% policy case, CO₂ emissions peak by 2030

In its climate pledge, policymakers in China aim to halt the rise in the nation's 
CO2 emissions trajectory at latest by 2030, and increase the share of non-fossil 
energy in the primary energy mix to 20% by the same year. Here we consider 
multiple scenarios for annual CO2 intensity reduction, and find that a 4%/year
reduction is consistent with peaking emissions at latest by 2030.
