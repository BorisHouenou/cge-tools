Title: Climate Policy Scenarios
SubTitleHead: How will climate policy targets in China affect CO2 emissions?
SubTitle: China’s climate pledge aims to halt the rise in the nation's CO₂ emissions trajectory at latest by 2030, and increase the share of non-fossil energy in the primary energy mix to 20% by the same year, targeting an overall reduction in CO₂ intensity of 60-65% in 2030, relative to the 2005 level. Assume an economic growth trajectory consistent with China’s goal to become a well-off society in 2030, we find that targeting a reduction in CO₂ intensity of 4%/year from 2015 to 2030 is consistent with peaking emissions at latest by 2030.

BodyTitle: The C-REM is a global energy-economic model with sub-national detail for China. 

The China Regional Energy Model (C-REM) model allows us to compare China’s national and regional CO2 emissions, air pollution, health, and a variety of other indicators under alternative policy scenarios. The C-REM is an energy-economic model that is calibrated to actual provincial data for 2007 and 2010, and used to project to 2030. Trade is represented with the rest of the world, which is grouped into four regions.
