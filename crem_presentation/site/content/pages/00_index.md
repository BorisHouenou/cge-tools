SubTitleHead: Explore the Impacts of Climate Policy in China on Energy, Emissions, Air Quality, and Health
SubTitle: In every nation, sound climate policy design benefits from an understanding of the system-wide response and its associated uncertainties. This response includes not only reductions in CO₂ emissions, but also impacts on the energy system, economy, air quality, and human health. This site is devoted to understanding climate policy impacts in China, and accompanies the *Nature Climate Change* article [“Air quality co-benefits of carbon pricing in China”](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0139-4) (doi: 10.1038/s41558-018-0139-4).

BodyTitle: About the MIT-Tsinghua China Energy and Climate Project

Launched in mid-2011, the MIT-Tsinghua China Energy and Climate Project began as a five-year project devoted to understanding the impact of climate policy on China’s energy and economic system, and continues today as a close collaboration among MIT and Tsinghua researchers. A core component of this project has involved developing a regional energy-economic model for China and linking it with a state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry model to capture impacts of policy on energy, emissions, air quality, and human health.
