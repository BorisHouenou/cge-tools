Title: Air pollution
SubTitleHead: China has a unique opportunity to clean up CO₂ and local air pollution at the same time.
SubTitle: All CO₂ policies deliver substantial reductions in CO₂ emissions (left panel) as well as energy-linked local air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX, which reduce the formation of PM2.5 (right panel), an air pollutant that is harmful to human health.

BodyTitle: All CO₂ policies halt the rise in air pollution – but complementary measures will be needed to meet near-term air quality targets.

Increasing levels of climate policy stringency lead to ever greater reductions in local air pollution. However, additional complementary measures will be needed to meet China’s ambient air quality target of 35μg/m³ by 2020. A CO₂ price discourages reliance on any air pollution control measure that would inadvertently increase CO₂ emissions in the near term, for instance, by requiring CO₂-intensive energy to operate, as in the case of operating scrubbers on coal-fired power plants. Under these conditions, solutions that reduce fossil fuel use altogether will be preferred, for instance, energy efficiency and deployment of non-fossil energy.
