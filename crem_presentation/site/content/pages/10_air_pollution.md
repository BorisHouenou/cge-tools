BodyTitle: All CO₂ policies halt the rise in air pollution - although they don't meet China's tough air quality target (<35μg/m3 by 2020)

A policy that targets CO2 decreases energy use and changes the composition of the 
energy mix in ways that affect other energy-linked pollutants. In particular,
a CO2 policy has the effect of reducing SO2 emissions, and to a lesser extent, NOX
emissions. These reductions improve local air quality, although not to the 
extent required by near-term air pollution action plans, which target ambient air
quality levels of 35 ug/m3.
