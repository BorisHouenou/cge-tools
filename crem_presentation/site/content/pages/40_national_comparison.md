SubTitle: In the 4% policy case, CO₂ emissions peak by 2030; the non-fossil target is met; and health improves. In addition, as you increase CO₂ policy stringency, co-benefits do not diminish.

BodyTitle: Comparing across the policy scenarios

Taken together, we can see how in the 4% scenario, China's climate pledge is
achieved, with substantial co-benefits for local pollution and human health.
To achieve near-term air quality goals, a CO2 price will need to be accompanied 
by complementary measures to address air pollution formation, such as ammonia 
controls and end-of-pipe cleanup on remaining coal-fired power stations.
