SubTitleHead: CO₂ policy impacts: Summary
SubTitle: To reach a CO₂ emissions peak by 2030 under baseline economic assumptions, China’s CO₂ intensity will need to fall between 4%-5%/year.  In the 4% policy case, CO₂ emissions peak before 2030, the non-fossil target is met, and PM2.5 concentrations rise more slowly.

BodyTitle: Comparing across the policy scenarios 

Taken together, we can see how in the 4% scenario, China's climate pledge is achieved, with substantial co-benefits for local pollution and human health. To achieve near-term air quality goals, a CO₂ price will need to be accompanied by complementary measures to address air pollution formation, such as ammonia controls and end-of-pipe cleanup on remaining coal-fired power stations.
