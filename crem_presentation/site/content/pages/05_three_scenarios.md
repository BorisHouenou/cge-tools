Title: Policy scenarios
SubTitleHead: China’s Climate Pledge
SubTitle: [China’s climate pledge](http://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/China/1/China's%20INDC%20-%20on%2030%20June%202015.pdf) aims to halt the rise in the nation's CO₂ emissions trajectory at latest by 2030, and increase the share of non-fossil energy in the primary energy mix to 20% by the same year, targeting an overall reduction in CO₂ intensity of 60-65% in 2030, relative to the 2005 level. This reduction goal is equivalent to a roughly 4%/year decline in CO₂ intensity from 2015-2030.

<h4>Our Goal</h4>
Our goal in this analysis is to develop intuition about the impact of alternative levels of climate policy stringency. We project and compare the evolution of China’s energy and economic system under increasingly stringent national CO₂ intensity reduction targets, which are achieved via a CO₂ price. We compare all policy scenarios to a No Policy counterfactual, which assumes that no climate policy is in place after 2010. We use the No Policy scenario as a benchmark to assess the implications of a CO₂ price that achieves increasingly stringent annual reductions in CO₂ intensity, as follows:

<h5 style="color: #48B4AC">3% scenario</h5>
Carbon intensity falls by 3%/year from 2010 to 2030, starting in 2010. Consistent with China’s previous declared level of effort under the 2009 Copenhagen climate pledge. In reality, China’s CO₂ emissions intensity reduction has exceed 3%/year from 2010 to 2015.

<h5 style="color: #FF8D64">4% scenario</h5>
Carbon intensity falls by 4%/year from 2010 to 2030, starting in 2010. *Consistent with China’s current pledge.*

<h5 style="color: #BC6FC8">5% scenario</h5>
Carbon intensity falls by 5%/year from 2010 to 2030, starting in 2010. More aggressive than China’s current pledge. China’s CO2 intensity approaches the U.S. 2010 level by 2030. 

The CO₂ price rises under each constraint, with steeper increases required to achieve more stringent CO₂ intensity targets. All scenarios include the pre-existing feed-in tariff for renewable energy, which is financed via an electricity price surcharge. Economic growth is an input to the model in each future period, such that all scenarios explored here embody an economic growth trajectory. In most of the scenarios we present, economic growth follows a rising path, consistent with China’s stated goal to become a well-off society by 2050. We explore sensitivity of our results to slower economic growth in one set of scenarios.

<h4>Modeling Framework</h4>
In this analysis, we employ the Regional Emissions Air Quality Climate and Health (REACH) modeling framework, which combines the CECP-developed China Regional Energy Model (C-REM) with the latest available air pollutant emissions inventory for China and a state-of-the art atmospheric chemistry model (GEOS-Chem). The C-REM is a global energy-economic model with sub-national detail for China that is calibrated to actual provincial data for 2007 and 2010, and used to project to 2030. Trade is represented with the rest of the world, which is grouped into four regions. Energy- and output-based emissions factors are applied to C-REM outputs in each projected model year to calculate emissions, which are used as an input to GEOS-Chem to forecast future regional air quality impacts. Combining simulated air quality with the spatial distribution of the population allows for the calculation of health impacts.
