Title: Economic growth
SubTitleHead: Slower economic growth means an earlier CO₂ emissions peak, less expansion of non-fossil energy 
SubTitle: If economic growth is 1 percentage point slower in every year between 2010 and 2030, relative to the baseline scenario, an emissions peak is achieved earlier for a given level of policy stringency.

BodyTitle: Projections are very sensitive to economic growth assumptions

In a slower economic growth scenario, China’s climate pledge is met earlier and with less expansion of non-fossil energy. In absolute terms, less non-fossil energy deployment will be required to meet the 20% target in 2030. Slower growth will place greater financial pressure on fossil generators, providing them with a stronger incentive to oppose increases in non-fossil generation.
