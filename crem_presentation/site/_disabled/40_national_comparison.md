BodyTitle: Comparing across the policy scenarios

In the 4% scenario, China's climate pledge is achieved, with substantial co-benefits in the form of improved air quality. The non-fossil energy target is also reached, as its share reaches 23% in 2030 (right panel). To achieve near-term air quality goals, a CO₂ price will need to be accompanied by complementary measures to address air pollution formation, such as ammonia controls and end-of-pipe cleanup on remaining coal-fired power stations (middle panel).
